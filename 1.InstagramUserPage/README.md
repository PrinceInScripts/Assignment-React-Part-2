# My Instagram App

This project is a simple React application for an Instagram-like login and signup experience. It includes basic components such as Button, Input, and Logo, as well as two pages: Login and Signup.

## Assignment Overview

The main goal of this project is to create a user interface for a login page and a signup page using React, Vite, and React Router. The project structure includes components for reusability and separate pages for navigation.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Component Creation**: Creating reusable components (Button, Input, and Logo) posed no significant challenges. Ensure that the components suit your styling and functional requirements.

2. **Routing with React Router**: Setting up routing using React Router was straightforward. Make sure to import `useNavigate` from 'react-router-dom' to handle page navigation.

3. **Styling and API Integration**: Styling and integrating with the Instagram API for actual authentication are not covered in this basic template. Additional work is needed for a fully functional application.

## Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   git clone https://github.com/KnihtKingCoder/Assignment-React-Part-2/tree/main/1.InstagramUserPage
   cd InstagramUserPAge

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   npm install

3. **Run the Application:**
  npm run dev
  This will start the development server. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

4. **Explore the Pages:**
   The default route '/' will display the Login page.
   Clicking the "Sign Up" button will navigate to the Signup page at '/signup'

**Note**
This project is a basic template and does not handle actual user authentication. It serves as a starting point for further development.
Customize the components, styling, and integrate with your authentication backend to make it a fully functional Instagram login/signup application.
