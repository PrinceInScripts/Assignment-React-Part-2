# React Counter App

This simple React Counter App allows you to increment and decrement a counter using buttons.

## Components

1. **Button Component**

The `Button` component is a reusable component that takes two props - "text" and "onClick" - and displays a button element with the given text. It is used for the increment and decrement buttons.

2. **Counter App**
The Counter component is the main component that uses useState to manage the counter state. It includes two buttons - one for incrementing and one for decrementing the counter.

3. **Styling with Tailwind CSS**
This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Ensure that you have Tailwind CSS properly configured in your project.
